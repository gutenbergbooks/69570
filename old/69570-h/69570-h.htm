<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>THE WIGWAM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN, after a long winter in the city,
Kenneth and Rose came back to the
Island which was their summer home, they
were eager to see all their favorite places.</p>

<p>On the very first morning they both wanted
to visit the bathing beach and the Indian forest,
the chasm and the pirate cave. They wanted
to know what new wonders had sprouted in
the garden of live flowers, and how much
their little oak tree had grown. They wanted
to see if there were any deer tracks down by
the spring, and if there was still a wasp’s nest
in a certain spot under the stone wall. Besides,
there was the beech tree, where Rose had her
summer-house; and the theatre among the
rocks, where they used to speak pieces; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
the post office in the hollow pine,—and a
hundred other places which they loved. It was
very hard to choose. But finally they decided
that most they wanted to see the wigwam in
the forest.</p>

<p>They had discovered the wigwam in the
forest by accident one day last summer, and
they had seen it only that once; for the very
next day they went back to the city. What a
pity they had not found it sooner! Kenneth
and Rose could hardly wait for summer to come
so that they could visit it again; it was such a
lovely place in which to play Indian hunter.</p>

<p>This first morning was not a very good one
for a walk in the woods. It was gray and misty,
threatening rain before night. But the children
were not going to postpone their plans on that
account. Kenneth put on his Indian suit, and
took his bow and arrows. Rose wore her moccasins
and wampum belt. Kenneth was sure
that he remembered the way to the wigwam,
although it was a long distance and he had
gone but once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>The forest came close to the back door of
Sweetbrier Cottage, and the children entered
it by the same path up which the little Prouts
came every day to bring the milk. Presently
they came to another path, which branched to
the right. This one was very narrow and indistinct,
difficult to follow even in bright sunlight,
but Kenneth remembered it well.</p>

<p>Soon they were in the midst of the dim,
gray-green forest. The trees were so thick
that there was little sunshine here, even on
a pleasant day. They trotted happily along,
their feet crunching the dry twigs and springing
on the elastic moss. How good it seemed
to feel the pine needles under foot, instead of
brick sidewalks and asphalt!</p>

<p>The path grew fainter and fainter. It wavered
and branched and strayed off in every
direction, as if it were not quite sure which
way to go. But Kenneth seemed to know
where to turn, just as Indian hunters always
do. Rose thought him wonderful. She did
not remember anything at all except the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
greenness of the moss and ferns and the brownness
of the tree-trunks. On they went, farther
and farther.</p>

<p>“I think we are almost there now,” said
Kenneth at last. “I remember that old dead
pine, don’t you, Rose?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Rose honestly. “I don’t remember.
But I do think we must be almost
there. It seems a long, long way.”</p>

<p>But when they came into the open space
beyond the pine tree, there was no wigwam
waiting them. Kenneth looked surprised.</p>

<p>“Well, it must be just a little farther,” he
said. And they trudged on. It was growing
darker and darker in the forest. A gray veil
seemed to be drawing around them, hiding
the way. Rose shivered.</p>

<p>“I wish I had worn my coat,” she said.
“I think it is going to rain, Kenneth. Don’t
you think we had better go home?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” cried Kenneth. “We are
almost there now. Yes,—I remember that oak
tree with the big rock beside it. I am <i>sure</i> we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
are there now;” and he brushed eagerly through
the bushes.</p>

<p>But when they passed the oak tree, there
was no wigwam. Rose shook her curls uneasily.
“I want to go home,” she said. “It
isn’t nice in the forest when there is no sunshine.
The trees are full of gray smoke. I
wish we had waited for a sunny day.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t smoke, it is fog,” said Kenneth.
“I am sure that this <i>was</i> the place, but the
wigwam is gone. Somebody must have pulled
it down. Perhaps the Indians themselves came
back.”</p>

<p>Rose looked over her shoulder anxiously.
“Let’s go home,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps we had better,” agreed Kenneth.
He remembered that sometimes the
Island fogs grew so thick that even the fishermen
were afraid of losing their way.</p>

<p>They turned about and started towards the
little thin path which they had left a few minutes
earlier. But where had the path gone?
They could not find it anywhere. The fog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
was creeping around them so that they could
see scarcely ten feet ahead. Kenneth took Rose
by the hand, and together they stumbled on
over the moss and dead branches. But still they
found no path. Every few minutes they would
stop and look about, and then, fearing that
they were going wrong, would start in another
direction. The fog grew thicker, and
they could hardly see one another. Kenneth’s
cap was dewed with heavy drops, and Rose’s
curls looked almost as though she had been in
bathing.</p>

<p>She squeezed Kenneth’s hand tightly. “Are
we lost, Kenneth?” she asked, in a brave
voice.</p>

<p>“No, we aren’t lost,” he answered. “We
know where we are,—right in the middle
of the forest. But I can’t remember the way
home. Let us shout. Perhaps some one will
hear us and show us the way.”</p>

<p>They shouted as loudly as they could,—“Hello!
Hello! Hello-o-o!” again and
again; but nobody answered. There was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
a sound in the forest; only cold, damp, gray
fog came sifting silently everywhere.</p>

<p>“I wish we hadn’t come,” said Rose. “Shall
we get home before night? I shouldn’t like
to sleep in the forest. There might be snakes.”</p>

<p>Suddenly they ran into something like a
wooden fence. “Hurrah!” cried Kenneth.
“Look, Rose, here is the wigwam now. I
told you we were near it all the time.”</p>

<p>Kenneth was right. There they stood in
the very door of the wigwam, which had been
hidden by the fog.</p>

<p>They gave a shout of joy and went inside.
Yes, there it stood, just as they had left it a
year ago. There was the piny roof, the pile of
brush for a sofa; the little heap of stones which
had been their play stove; the cupboard made
of a hollow log.</p>

<p>“Somebody has been in our house,” said
Kenneth, like the Great Big Bear in the story.
“Here are some pieces of broken crockery.”</p>

<p>“Somebody has been sitting on our sofa,”
cried Rose, like the Middle-sized Bear, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
she has left her shawl. See!”—she held up
a plaid shawl. “It is nice and warm. I am
going to put it on.”</p>

<p>“It is an Indian blanket,” said Kenneth.
“And look! Somebody has been into our cupboard
and has left something to eat!” he cried,
like the Little Wee Bear. He held up a pail
full of blueberries, big and ripe and luscious.
“Rose, it must be the Indians!”</p>

<p>Both the children glanced at the door and
shivered. Never had the Indians seemed so
near. It was very creepy here alone in the
forest. The fog might be hiding all sorts of
dangers which they could not see.</p>

<p>But soon Rose took courage. “I don’t believe
it was Indians,” she said. “Indians don’t
leave things all ready for lost children. It must
be the fairies. I <i>knew</i> there were fairies in
this forest. I have told you so, Kenneth, ever
so many times. I am hungry and I am going
to eat the berries. If the fairies left them it
will be perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Kenneth, who did not believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
in fairies. But he decided to help eat
the berries. The two sat down on the pine-bough
sofa and began to dip out handful after
handful. And the luncheon tasted so good
that they spoke hardly a word for five minutes.
The wigwam was as quiet as before
they had come.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>INDIANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SUDDENLY, outside the wigwam, a twig
snapped. There was,—yes, there certainly
was a rustle in the bushes. Steps were
creeping towards the wigwam. It sounded
like an Indian. Kenneth grabbed his bow and
arrows. Rose kept very still, but her fingers
trembled. They both sat staring at the door
of the wigwam.</p>

<p>Stealthily a face came peering around the
side of the door—a dark, reddish-brown face,
with bright eyes. Then another face appeared;
then another. It seemed as if the fog were
full of eager faces and shiny, black eyes.</p>

<p>“It is the Indians!” said Kenneth to himself.
“At last they have really come!” He
lifted his bow and pointed the arrow at the
face of the tallest Indian. But just as he was
about to let the arrow fly, the head in the doorway
moved and a voice cried,—</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i025.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">KENNETH AND ROSE SEE A STRANGE FACE IN THE
WIGWAM</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“Don’t shoot! I am a friend.”</p>

<p>Kenneth’s arm dropped with surprise, and
as it did so a figure stole into the tent. Behind it,
out of the fog, crept five other figures in Indian
file, each shorter than the one before it. They
were none of them big or terrible. The tallest
was about Kenneth’s own height, and the
smallest was hardly more than a baby. Three
of them were boys and three were girls, and
the little ones kept behind the others as if they
were afraid.</p>

<p>“Ho!” said Kenneth. “I thought at first
you were Indians!” and he began to laugh.</p>

<p>The biggest boy laughed, too. “No, we
aren’t Indians,” he said shyly. “We are Captain
Prout’s children from the Cove. I am
Tom and this is Mary. That one with the
freckles is Susan, and the three little ones are
Bill and Bob and Jane.”</p>

<p>“The little Prouts!” exclaimed Rose; and
they all looked at one another curiously. Although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Kenneth and Rose had been coming
to the Island for years, this was the first time
that they had stood face to face with their little
neighbors who brought the milk every morning.
The Prout children had always been very
shy. After they had stared for some time, Kenneth
remembered to be polite.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” he said. “I am Kenneth
Thornton, and this is my sister Rose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we know who you are,” said Mary
Prout, “and we knew you came yesterday.
We heard you yell for help just now, and we
guessed where we’d find you. We were right
close by. We were coming back to get the
berries that Sue left here,”—she stopped abruptly,
seeing the empty pail which Rose was
holding.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry!” said Rose. “We
have eaten all your lovely berries; but we
thought the fairies had brought them to
us.” Then they all laughed and felt better
acquainted. “I suppose this is your shawl,
too?” asked Rose, pulling it off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>“Yes,” said Mary, “but you are very welcome
to it and the berries, too. I am so glad
we left them here!”</p>

<p>“But how did you know about our wigwam?”
said Kenneth.</p>

<p>The little Prouts looked at one another and
laughed. “Why, you see,” said Tom, “we
thought it was <i>our</i> wigwam. We built it, you
know”—</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> built it!” interrupted Kenneth and
Rose together.</p>

<p>“We thought it was the Indians,” explained
Kenneth.</p>

<p>“What clever children you are!” said Rose
admiringly.</p>

<p>The little Prouts looked pleased and proud.
The three smallest ones stole out from behind
Tom and Mary and Sue, and stood in a half
circle around Kenneth and Rose.</p>

<p>“Then we had no right to come here at all,”
said Kenneth, much mortified. “We were very
rude to walk into your house and eat up your
berries and wear your shawl. But we did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
know. Come, Rose;” and he started for the
door.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>please</i> don’t go!” begged Tom and
Mary together. And Susan and Bill and Bob
and Jane said, “<i>Please</i> don’t go!”</p>

<p>“Won’t you stay and play Indian hunter,
the way you did that day last year?” said
Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, how did you know about that?”
asked Kenneth, in surprise. “You were not
here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we were,” nodded Mary. “We were
right over there behind the big rock. We
watched you all the time.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come and play with
us?” said Rose. “It would have been so
much nicer with eight of us, instead of two.”</p>

<p>The faces of the little Prouts lighted up
joyously. “Oh, would you play with us?”
said Tommy.</p>

<p>“We didn’t dare, then,” said Mary shyly.
“But now it’s different.”</p>

<p>Susan drew close to Rose and touched her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
hand gently. “We know about ‘Brothers
and Sisters’ now,” she said. “You told in the
letter when you sent us the box of lovely
Christmas things that we were all like brothers
and sisters together, because we had one
Father. So we aren’t going to be afraid of
you any more. You were so kind to us!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Kenneth awkwardly,
for he hated to be thanked. “We
didn’t do anything. But it will be fine to
have a big band of Indians and Pirates. Shall
we play Indian now?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” they all cried, dancing up and
down like real little Indians. And so they
played together. Tommy was the Indian chief,
and Rose, Bill, and little Jane were in his
band. Kenneth was Hawkeye, the famous
Indian hunter, with Mary for his trusty guide,
and Susan and Bob were his scouts.</p>

<p>All that morning the foggy forest rang with
the sound of war whoops and the shouts of
victorious hunters, as the fights raged about
the wigwam. It was great fun. The Indian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
chief knew the woods so well that he could
find his way everywhere, even in the thick
fog. Hawkeye would have had a hard time
trying to find him but for the service of his
brave scouts. As it was, they had some narrow
escapes from being scalped. But they finally
captured Jane-Little-Injun as their prisoner.</p>

<p>By this time they knew, because of their
hungriness, that it must be noon. So they
called a parley with the Indians, and smoked
a peace pipe—Susan found one growing in
the forest.</p>

<p>“I suppose we must go home,” said Kenneth,
with a sigh. Then his face fell. The
fog was thicker than ever, and he knew that
he could never find his way home. He hated
to confess it to the Indian chief. But Tommy
Prout was a thoughtful Indian.</p>

<p>“We have smoked the peace pipe,” he
said. “Now we Indians will go with Hawkeye
and his braves and show you the quick
trail home.”</p>

<p>And back through the fog they went in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Indian file, talking and laughing and telling
one another about things which were so
different in the city and on the Island; for
the little Prouts were full of eager questions
about the city, which they had never seen,
while Kenneth and Rose were just as anxious
to know what the Island was like in the
winter.</p>

<p>When they reached the broad path by the
back door, Tommy and the other Prout children
said good-by, and started back to the
Cove, because it was late, and their father
and mother did not know where they were.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said Kenneth and Rose.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to come to-morrow to play
with us again,” added Kenneth.</p>

<p>“Be sure and bring your dolls,” said Rose
to the little girls. “And they shall all play
with my Alice under the beech tree.”</p>

<p>You can imagine whether or not the little
Prouts promised to come.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE ANTS’ FIRE-ESCAPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was not quite bedtime; for they had tea
early at the Island, so that after the fire was
lighted in the big chimney the children might
have a little hour with the grown-ups for a
game or a story, or for whatever pleasant thing
might happen.</p>

<p>Kenneth and Rose ran to get their fat cushions,
and put them down in the two corners
of the hearth. Kenneth’s cushion was red, and
he always sat on the right hand of the fireplace.
Rose’s cushion was blue, and she sat on
the left.</p>

<p>Papa began to poke the fire to make it burn
more brightly, for it was not so big and bustling
a blaze as usual.</p>

<p>“Somebody forgot to fill the wood-box,” he
said. “We need a nice crisp birch log to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
the fire crackle. Who wants to run out to the
wood-pile and bring one in?”</p>

<p>“I do!” cried Kenneth, jumping up eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do!” cried Rose, jumping up too.</p>

<p>“Well, you may both go,” said Papa. “And
between you I think you can bring in a good
big one. But mind not to trip over it.”</p>

<p>Out they ran to the wood-pile, which was
close behind the house on the edge of the
forest, where Rose suspected that the fairies
lived, and where Kenneth was sure that there
were Indians. But neither Kenneth nor Rose
was afraid. They were very brave children,
especially by daylight.</p>

<p>“Here is a nice little log,” said Rose.</p>

<p>“Oh, that isn’t half big enough,” cried
Kenneth scornfully. “Let’s carry this one,
Rose. This is something like;” and he seized
one of the very largest logs in the wood-pile.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Rose; and she bravely
stretched her little arms around the other
end. They tugged and they tugged, and they
grunted and grunted, and they pulled and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
pulled; and finally, after pushing and hauling
and rolling and shoving it, they got the log
up on to the piazza, where it fell with a <i>bang!</i>
Out came their father and mother to see what
all the noise meant.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” cried their mother. “How
could you two children bring in such an
enormous log as that? Aren’t your poor little
backs broken?”</p>

<p>“I’m not so very small. I’m ten,” said
Kenneth, drawing himself up.</p>

<p>“And I am seven,” said Rose proudly.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said their father; “it is good
exercise for them, Mama, and will make them
big and strong. Don’t you remember the story
about the poor little girl who learned to carry
a cow upstairs, and so the Prince married her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, how did she learn?” cried Rose
eagerly. “Could I do it?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, she carried the little calf
upstairs every day—every day of its life. Of
course it was growing all the time, so that before
she knew it, the calf had become a big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
cow, and the little girl was carrying the cow
upstairs as easily as you please. Then the
Prince came along and married her.”</p>

<p>“That sounds like one of Aunt Clare’s
stories,” said Rose.</p>

<p>“What did he want to marry her for?”
asked Kenneth. “Princes’ wives don’t need
to carry cows, do they?”</p>

<p>“Well, I forget the rest of the story,” said
Papa. “But there was a reason; a very good
reason indeed, if I could only remember it.
There always is a reason for things in fairy
stories, isn’t there, Rosie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” said Rose. But Kenneth
sniffed.</p>

<p>Papa seized the big log in both arms as
easily as the Princess did the cow, carried it in
and threw it on the fire, which spouted up with
a burst of sparks, like a fiery fountain. The
bark began to crackle deliciously. Rose and
Kenneth cuddled down on their cushions, one
on each side of the fire, and watched the little
tongues of flame lick the old log greedily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
They loved the fire. Usually it made somebody
think of a story.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rose cried out “Oh!” so loudly
that even Kenneth jumped. Rose was pointing
into the fire, and her forehead was puckered
with distress.</p>

<p>“Why, what is it, Rose?” asked her
mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” cried Rose again. “Oh, the
poor little ants! Do look!”</p>

<p>Sure enough! the old log must have been
an ants’ house. The poor little things were
creeping out of the holes in it and scurrying
wildly about in every direction, seeking a way
of escape from their dwelling, which was
growing hotter and hotter every minute.</p>

<p>The foremost of them tried to climb down
the andirons. But these were too hot, and
soon they went scurrying back again. They
grew wilder and wilder, wandering about
crazily as if they did not know what to do.
Their home was surrounded by flame on every
side. Some of them tried to jump down. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Rose shuddered to see the poor things fall into
the fire or upon the hot hearth and shrivel
up into sad little cinders. It was too dreadful!</p>

<p>“Oh, Mama and Papa, what shall we do?”
she cried. “I cannot bear to see them. It is
just like a house full of people being burned,
with nobody to help. Kenneth, can’t we do
something?”</p>

<p>“Ding-dong! Call out the fire-engine!”
roared Kenneth, jumping up and galloping to
the kitchen for a pail of water. Kenneth was
always ready for a new game.</p>

<p>“Water will do no good. You cannot put
out the fire without drowning them,” called
Kenneth’s father. “I am afraid the poor ants
are doomed, Rosie. It is like a crowded
tenement house, isn’t it?” he said to Mama.
“The poor little creatures crowd together like
people in the upper-story windows, hoping
for a ladder.”</p>

<p>“That is what they need—a fire-escape,”
cried Rose. “Oh, I must make a fire-escape
quickly!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>She ran to the wood-box and seized a long,
flat piece of wood. This she took for her fire-escape,
resting one end on the rug in front
of the hearth, and the other on top of the log
which had now caught fire and was blazing
briskly. It made a nice little bridge from
the burning wood above the hot hearthstone.
Almost immediately an ant spied the fire-escape
and started across it eagerly. Another
followed him; then another and another, until
a constant procession was filing down the
bridge toward safety.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Rose, as the first ant
reached the rug; but she stopped suddenly.
“Look at him!” she cried. “He is going
<i>back</i>!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, back he was going,—back
to the burning log. And all the other ants
were doing the same thing. One after another
they returned up the fire-escape, stopping to
wave their feelers and make signs to all the
ants whom they met coming down. They
must have told these last something to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
them change their minds; for every single
one turned about as soon as he was told.
Presently it was plain what they meant. The
ants were coming out in crowds, and each
was carrying something white in its mouth.</p>

<p>“The ant babies! They are trying to save
the ant babies!” cried Rose. And that is
exactly what they were doing. Eagerly the
children watched the crowds running down
the fire-escape with their precious burdens.
Faster and faster they came, and the hearthrug
was black with them when Papa took it
up gently and carried it out to shake it over
the piazza railing. How glad the poor little
ants must have been to feel the cool grass
under their feet!</p>

<p>They were all saved at last, and it was high
time, for the log was now one mass of flame.</p>

<p>“I think you should have a fireman’s medal
for life-saving, Rose,” said her mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>I</i> ought not to have a medal,” said
Rose modestly. “I only built the fire-escape.
But every one of those brave ants who came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
back into the fire and saved the babies ought
to have one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we should call them Heroes if they
had been men,” said Papa.</p>

<p>“They would rather have something sweet
than a medal,” said Kenneth, who knew a
great deal about sweet things.</p>

<p>“Sure enough!” cried Rose, clapping her
hands. “Mama, may I scatter some sugar
out there in the grass where Papa shook the
ants?”</p>

<p>Her mother said that she might. So I
dare say the rescued ants had a jolly banquet
that night to celebrate their wonderful escape.
But I suppose that the ant babies were too
little to share in it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>BEECH HOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BRIGHT and early the next morning a
small procession came up the path to
Sweetbrier Cottage. It was the little Prouts,
making their first real visit to the Thornton
children. Tom and Mary led the way. It was
the second time they had come that morning.
Once, before daylight, they had traveled over
the same path to bring the milk for Kenneth’s
and Rose’s breakfast. But they did not mind
an extra walk of a mile or two. Behind Mary
and Tom came Susan, holding little Jane by
the hand, and after them trotted Bill and Bob.
The three girls carried each a doll, dressed in
her prettiest clothes.</p>

<p>It was a great event for the little Prouts.
They were rather frightened when they found
the piazza empty and no one anywhere to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
seen. They had hoped that Kenneth and Rose
would be outside waiting for them. That
would have made them a little less bashful.
They did not know what to do next, so they
gathered in a bunch and began to whisper.</p>

<p>“You must knock on the door, Tom,” said
Mary.</p>

<p>“No, <i>you</i> do it,” said Tom, hanging back.</p>

<p>“Let’s all go together, then,” whispered
Mary, looking timidly at the front steps; for
she remembered how once she had been frightened
at this same place by the ringing of a
terrible bell. So all the little Prouts took hold
of hands and advanced in a crowd. But just
as they were going to mount the steps the door
swung open, and out came Mrs. Thornton
with the baby in her arms. From the window
she had seen the little Prouts coming. She
smiled at them kindly and said,—</p>

<p>“Good-morning, little neighbors. I am very
glad to see you. I suppose you are looking
for Kenneth and Rose, aren’t you? Well, they
are expecting you, and they are waiting down
under the beech tree. Come, and I will show
you the way.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i045.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">THE LITTLE PROUTS COME TO MAKE THEIR FIRST CALL</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>They followed Mrs. Thornton down the
green slope, around big rocks and under the
pine trees on top of the cliff, until they came
to a huge beech tree, the only one on the
Island.</p>

<p>“This is the place,” said Mrs. Thornton.
The little Prouts could dimly see somebody
moving about beyond the green wall of leaves.
But no one came to meet them. “We must
let them know that we are here,” explained
Mrs. Thornton, and she pulled down a branch
of the beech tree which was in front of her.
On the end dangled a tin horn.</p>

<p>“This is the way visitors do when they
come to Beech House,” she said. Then she
blew a long blast on the horn. “Now a little
one for the baby,” she added, blowing again,
very softly. “There, Tommy, now it is your
turn. You must each blow, so that they may
know how many guests to expect.”</p>

<p>Tommy blew the horn so loudly that Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Thornton jumped. Then Mary blew, then
Susan, and Bill, and Bob. Last of all, little Jane
blew. But she scarcely made any sound at all.</p>

<p>When the echo of all these blowings had
died away, Kenneth and Rose lifted up the
branch and looked out.</p>

<p>“Welcome, eight strangers!” said Kenneth,
bowing very low.</p>

<p>“Welcome to Beech House,” said Rose,
making a neat courtesy. Then they led their
visitors in,—all but Mrs. Thornton and the
baby, who said they must go back to the house.</p>

<p>The little Prouts followed Kenneth and
Rose into Beech House, and a fine house it
was! The great beech tree arched over like
an enormous umbrella. On every side the
branches came down close to the ground, so
that the children were shut in by green walls,
like a tent. This was Rose’s summer-house,
where her dolls lived. Kenneth often played
here, too.</p>

<p>The little Prouts stared around them
with grins of delight. Beech House was all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
ready for a party. In the centre of the room
stood a little table, spread with a cloth and set
with dishes for eight people. About it were
several little chairs. Over in the corner was
another table, even tinier, and set with still
smaller dishes. At the head of this table sat
Alice, Rose’s best doll, and beside her was
Matilda, with the broken nose, whom Rose
loved almost as dearly as she loved Alice.</p>

<p>“We thought we would have a party,” said
Kenneth, “because this is the first time you
ever came to see us.”</p>

<p>“And, of course, the dolls had to have another
party to welcome your dolls,” added
Rose. “Come, Alice, and greet your little
new friends.”</p>

<p>Rose brought Alice forward, and she shook
hands with the three dolls which Mary, Susan,
and little Jane had brought. Now these were
the very same dolls which Rose had sent to
the little Prouts in the Christmas box, before
she had ever spoken a word to Mary or Susan
or Jane. So Rose was really better acquainted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
with the dolls, and with their dresses which
she had made, than she was with the Prout
girls themselves.</p>

<p>“How do you do? How do you do? How
do you do?” said Alice three times (in Rose’s
voice). “Come and sit down at the table near
my dear sister Matilda, who has only one leg,
so that she cannot rise to greet you very conveniently.”</p>

<p>Then the Teddy Bear was introduced. Rose
loved him too, but in a different way. He wore
a red sweater and a tam-o’-shanter cap. He
shook hands with the Prout dolls very politely,
and squeaked “How!” like an Indian. The
little Prouts had never before seen a Teddy
Bear, and at first they were afraid of him,
because they thought he was alive. Rose put
Teddy at the foot of the table, as he was the
only boy in the party.</p>

<p>When Teddy and the five dolls were seated
at their table, Rose and the other little girls
went back to where Kenneth was showing the
boys his camera and his tool-chest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Let’s play Desert Island,” said Kenneth.
“That is our favorite game. I am Robinson
Crusoe and Rose is my Man Friday. Let’s
play you are the Swiss Family Robinson, come
to have dinner with us. One, two, three, four,
five, six,—yes, you are just the right number!
You can be Mr. and Mrs. Robinson and
their four sons. Isn’t that splendid, Rose?”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” echoed Rose, clapping her
hands. “Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, will you and
your children please be seated?”</p>

<p>There were only four chairs, and these were
rather small ones. So Kenneth and Tom,
Mary and Rose, sat cross-legged on the ground.
Their chins came just above the edge of the
table, which made everybody laugh.</p>

<p>“Now, Man Friday,” said Robinson Crusoe,
“bring on the banquet.”</p>

<p>Friday ran to the little cupboard in the
corner. It was such a cunning little cupboard
that Mary said: “Oh, how did you
ever think of building one like that? It is so
easy, too!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“My Mama used to make them so when
she was a little girl,” said Rose. “She showed
me how. See, it is just two bricks with a
shingle laid across; then two more bricks on
top, and another shingle; and up, up, up, as
many shelves as you like. I have seven, and
they are very convenient.”</p>

<p>“We must build one in the wigwam,” said
Mary.</p>

<p>“Yes; that must be your Swiss Family
Robinson house, if this is our Crusoe one,”
said Kenneth.</p>

<p>Then Man Friday served the party. There
was bread and butter spread with marmalade,
and there were cookies and chocolate fudge,
and lemonade in a tall pitcher. It was a very
jolly party. Every one was happy. The Prouts
laughed all the time. You see, it was their
very first party!</p>

<p>When the Crusoe dinner was over, Kenneth
had still more things to show the Prout boys,
and the girls were just as much interested.
There was the express wagon, in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
provisions had been drawn down from Sweetbrier
Cottage. But in places where the path
was too narrow, they had been obliged to carry
it over the rocks in their arms. Rose told
how they had tipped over and wasted one
whole pitcher of lemonade!</p>

<p>Then there was the ring-toss game and the
animal circus. How the little Prouts did enjoy
the jointed animals, and the clown, and the
funny things which Kenneth and Rose made
them do! Fancy it! the little Prouts had
never seen a real circus! Kenneth and Rose
could hardly believe how any one could be so
unfortunate. But the little Prouts said that
they had never been away from the Island, and
of course the circus never came to the Island,
it was so far away from everywhere.</p>

<p>Rose and Kenneth said to themselves that,
after all, there are some unfortunate things
about living on an island.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>MUTINY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE the little ones were still playing
with the clown, the elephant, and the
donkey, Mary and Tom went about Beech
House looking at other things.</p>

<p>“What a queer flag!” cried Mary suddenly.
“It is not a bit like the Stars and
Stripes.” She was pointing to something tied
to a stick which stood against the tree-trunk.
It was a flag of black silk, and on it
was painted a skull with two bones crossed
below it.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know?” said Kenneth,
“that is a pirate flag. We always use it
whenever we play pirates.”</p>

<p>“What are pirates?” asked Mary.</p>

<p>“Oh, pirates are sea-robbers,” explained
Kenneth. “They used to sail all around the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
world in fast ships, and they captured other
sailors and killed them. Then they took their
treasures and buried them in places where
no one else could find them. Papa says that
perhaps they hid some of their treasure down
here in Maine. Did you ever find any pirate
gold, Tom?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tom. “But I never looked
for any. Perhaps if I had known I might
have found it. I’ll hunt for it some day.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all hunt for it!” said Kenneth.</p>

<p>“We played ‘Buried Treasure’ last summer,”
said Rose. “Aunt Clare showed me
how. It is a very good game for a sandy
beach, and I found ten cents.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Susan Prout eagerly. Ten
cents seemed to her a great deal of money.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Kenneth. “That was a
silly game. We will go and find real treasure,—gold
and jewels and things like that.
And we will be rich as anything.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Tom. Bill and Bob
echoed, “Hurrah!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“First we’ll form a pirate band,” went on
Kenneth. “Now there are so many of us it
will be jolly to play pirate. I’ll be Bloody
Dick. Tom, you can be Slippery Joe. We
will think up names for all the little ones,—and
for the girls, too. The girls will have to
play so that we can have a good big band.”</p>

<p>“Of course we shall play!” said Rose
stoutly. “We shall be the best pirates of all,
shan’t we, Mary?”</p>

<p>And Mary said, “Perhaps, when we know
how.”</p>

<p>“I say, Tom, you know where the pirate
cave is, don’t you?” asked Kenneth.</p>

<p>“You mean the cave down by Black
Rock?” asked Tom. “We don’t call it that,
though. We call it just ‘The Oven.’”</p>

<p>“Pirate Cave is a much better name,” said
Kenneth. “Well, Mama says that we can
have a picnic there some day. We children
will all be pirates, and the cave is our den.
Papa and Mama and the baby will be just
ordinary sailors with a treasure,—that’s the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
luncheon, of course. And we will capture
them and take them to the cave. Then we
will have the picnic. Won’t that be fine?”</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Tom. “That will be a great
game.”</p>

<p>“We must all have black masks like this,”
said Kenneth; and he clapped to his face a bit
of black cloth with two holes, through which
his eyes glowed fiercely.</p>

<p>The littlest Prouts began to scream. “Stop
that!” said Tom. “If you are going to bawl
you can’t be pirates. You will have to go with
the luncheon and be robbed.”</p>

<p>Bill and Bob and Jane were silent immediately.
They felt that it would be terrible not
to be pirates.</p>

<p>“Yes, we must all have masks and swords,
and red handkerchiefs tied around our necks,
and turbans, just like real pirates,” said Kenneth.
“See, I have a tin sword.”</p>

<p>“I think I can make the masks,” said Mary,
who had been examining Kenneth’s. “I can
sew a little, can’t you, Rose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“Oh, yes,” said Rose, thinking of the dolls’
dresses which she had made. “I can sew a
great deal.”</p>

<p>“And I can whittle,” said Tommy Prout.
“I will make wooden swords for all of us.”</p>

<p>“So can I,” said Kenneth. “I have a jolly
jack-knife—a real pirate ripper!” and he
flourished it in the air.</p>

<p>“Who will be captain?” said Rose suddenly.
“I suppose there has to be a captain?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Kenneth. “Of course there
must be a captain, to tell everybody what to
do.”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> be captain, Kenneth,” said Rose, who
admired her brother more than anything in
the world. Kenneth brandished his sword and
cried “Ho!” ferociously, as though he were
indeed a pirate chief.</p>

<p>“Tommy is the biggest,” said Susan jealously.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tommy’s the biggest,” echoed Bill
and Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, I know the Island pretty well,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
Tom. “I can sail a boat, too. I guess I’ll
make a good pirate, though I never played the
game before.”</p>

<p>“But the captain ought to know all about
it,” said Kenneth uneasily. “You know you
had never heard about pirates until I told
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I know <i>now</i>,” said Tommy, flushing;
“so what’s the difference? Do you want
to be everything?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t!” retorted Kenneth. “Yesterday
I let you be the Indian chief.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you were Hawkeye, the famous
hunter. That was just as good, wasn’t it?”
answered Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, if any one else is the pirate chief, I
shall not let him wear my sword,” declared
Kenneth.</p>

<p>“Stingy!” said Susan.</p>

<p>“I’ll whittle a better one!” Tom cried
triumphantly.</p>

<p>“I’m going home,” said Susan. “I shan’t
play unless Tom is the chief.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Go along, then!” said Rose, pouting.</p>

<p>Little Jane began to cry. Bill and Bob
doubled up their fists and looked very fierce.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let us quarrel!” said Mary, in
distress. And, indeed, it looked as though there
was to be trouble in Beech House.</p>

<p>“Let’s go home, Mary,” said Tom sullenly.
“We aren’t wanted here any longer.”</p>

<p>Kenneth stood with arms folded, kicking
the grass sulkily. Suddenly there came a tremendous
blow on the horn,—so loud that
everybody jumped, and Rose whispered in
blood-curdling tones the awful word “<i>Pirates!</i>”
But Kenneth soon remembered who
he was, and that Robinson Crusoe was never
afraid of anything, not even of cannibals.</p>

<p>“What ho!” he called bravely. “What
stranger seeks entrance to my house?” and he
strode to the door brandishing his sword. Suddenly
he gave a whoop of joy.</p>

<p>“Charlie!” he cried. “Charlie Carroll!
Where did you come from?”</p>

<p>“It’s a surprise!” said another voice, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
in came Kenneth with a boy of about the
same age, who was grinning all over his jolly
freckled face. Rose flew at him rapturously.</p>

<p>“Cousin Charlie!” she squealed. “Oh,
how nice!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Rose!” the boy said. “Having a
party?”</p>

<p>“They are the little Prouts,” whispered
Rose. “You remember, we told you about
them.”</p>

<p>“He is my cousin, Charlie Carroll,” explained
Kenneth to the Prout children. “I
say, Charlie, why didn’t you tell us you were
coming? Are you going to stay?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have come to stay four weeks,”
said Charlie. “Aunt Mollie asked me, and it
was to be a secret.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodie, goodie!” cried Rose, hopping
up and down. “What fine times we shall have
now!”</p>

<p>“I came up on the boat last night with
Aunt Clare,” said Charlie. “Uncle Jack met
us at the wharf this morning, and when Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
Mollie said you kids were all down here I ran
away and came as softly as I could so as to
surprise you.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Clare here, too! Oh, what fun!”
cried Rose.</p>

<p>“You came just in time to be a pirate,”
said Kenneth.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! you will be a pirate too, won’t
you, Charlie?” said Rose, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>“Pirates!” cried Charlie. “That sounds
fine. I’ll be Bulldog Bill.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cheered Kenneth. “We are
to have swords and masks, Charlie, and capture
a treasure and live in a cave.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t chosen a captain yet,” said
Rose. “Kenneth and Tom both want to be
captain, and we nearly quarreled about it before
you came.”</p>

<p>The children suddenly looked very much
ashamed. “I don’t want to be captain, Tom,”
said Kenneth. “You’ll do it better. Here,
you can have my sword.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tom, “I won’t take it. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
be captain. You know all about the game and
I don’t.”</p>

<p>Then Mary Prout had a great idea. “<i>You</i>
be pirate chief,” she said, turning to Charlie.
“That will settle the trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that is a good idea!” cried Rose.
“We will all do as you say, Charlie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have just come,” said Charlie. “I
don’t want to be chief the very first thing.”</p>

<p>“I’ll agree,” said Kenneth. “What do you
say, Tom?”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Tom. “I don’t care.
He’ll make a good pirate, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Of course he will!” cried Rose promptly.
“Charlie is great fun.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you,” said Charlie modestly.
“I’ll be captain first, so as to settle
things easily. But after that we’ll take turns.
Now let’s plan what we will do first.”</p>

<p>“All right!” they cried in chorus. Then
they sat down on the grass and told Charlie
about the adventure which they had planned
before he came. And the new captain said it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
was a very good plan indeed, and that they
would carry it out at the first chance.</p>

<p>So the tea-party ended happily after all,
and a mutiny among the pirate band was
averted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE PIRATE CAVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE morning, a week after the tea-party,
Mr. and Mrs. Thornton and Aunt Clare
went for a row on the water. They had two
large baskets packed full to overflowing with
something precious. They also took a stone
jug and a coffee-pot. It looked like a picnic
party. They were very merry, as if they expected
to have a pleasant time; and yet, it
may be that they had some idea of the danger
into which they were about to run, for they
did not take the baby with them.</p>

<p>There was no one in sight when they rowed
away from the landing. This was strange; for
usually there were half a dozen children, more
or less, in that neighborhood. Quite recently
stories had been told about a band of pirates
who had been seen prowling about the coast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Was it possible that these ruffians had anything
to do with the children’s disappearance?
Mr. and Mrs. Thornton seemed, however, to
have forgotten all about pirate stories, and
they rowed merrily away.</p>

<p>“Why, this might indeed be a desert island,”
said Aunt Clare, as they rounded point
after point with no sign of a house or a human
being. They passed several little coves
and cliffs, the bathing beach and the chasm,
and presently they came in sight of a larger
cove with a flat, stony beach. Beyond this a
rock extended out into the water like a platform.
At the back rose a steep cliff, with a
black cavity in the centre.</p>

<p>“There is the cave, up under that rock,” said
Mr. Thornton, as the boat grated on the beach.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a splendid place for a picnic!”
cried Aunt Clare, jumping out lightly. “Do
be careful not to upset those baskets; I am
dreadfully hungry already, and I don’t want
to lose a mouthful of the delicious luncheon
which Mollie has prepared.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Mr. Thornton helped out his wife and
pulled the empty boat up on the beach, where
the tide could not wash it away. “Now, then,”
said he, “I’ll take the pail of lobsters and
one of the baskets. Mama, you can take the
other basket. Clare, will you carry the jug
and the coffee-pot, please? Forward, march!
To the cave!”</p>

<p>Aunt Clare began to hum a tune, and they
all marched along in time to it, carrying the
luncheon carefully; but just as they were
about to enter the cave there came a terrible
sound,—a chorus of screams and shouts and
shrill whistles,—and a band of fierce and desperate
ruffians came rushing out of the cave
where they had been hidden, surrounding the
unfortunate picnickers.</p>

<p>These desperadoes were very dreadful to look
at. They wore black masks covering all their
faces except their eyes, and some of them had
long, black beards. They carried swords and
pistols, which they brandished in a very dangerous
manner. One of them waved a fearful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
black flag, with a skull and crossbones painted
upon it.</p>

<p>“Pirates!” gasped Aunt Clare. “We are
lost!”</p>

<p>“Pirates we are!” shouted the leader of
the band, in a terrible voice. “What are you
doing near our cave? I am Bloody Dick, and
you are our prisoners. Hand over your treasure
and come along to our captain, Bulldog
Bill. Then we’ll see what will happen to you
next!”</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but yield, for the
pirates were eight to three. Mr. and Mrs.
Thornton quickly handed over their baskets
and the pail,—Aunt Clare groaned when she
saw these treasures seized by the pirates. Then,
after a struggle, she herself was forced to give
up the jug and the coffee-pot. Bloody Dick
and Slippery Joe, the biggest of the band, tied
the hands of the prisoners with a piece of rope,
while the others danced about shouting and
screaming more like wild Indians than like
pirates.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i069.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">THE PIRATES ATTACK THE PICNIC PARTY</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Now come along!” growled Bloody Dick,
“and step lively, or the Captain will make you
all walk the plank.”</p>

<p>“What’s ‘walk the plank’?” whispered one
of the pirates in pigtails to another with long,
yellow curls.</p>

<p>“Charlie says that it is like the spring-board
which the boys use in swimming,”
answered the curly pirate. “But that doesn’t
sound very terrible, does it?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the pigtailed one. “But perhaps
there is something more.”</p>

<p>The procession marched up the rocks to the
entrance of the cave, led by Bloody Dick, who
held the end of the rope which bound all the
prisoners together, while Slippery Joe guarded
the rear. One by one the prisoners were pushed
in, bent almost double, for the opening was
low. But once inside, they found a high room,
big enough to hold them all. It was shadowy
but not very dark, for besides the door there
was a hole which went up through the roof
like a chimney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Oh, what a fine cave!” cried Aunt Clare,
forgetting that she was a prisoner.</p>

<p>“Sh!” warned Bloody Dick. Kenneth
looked so fierce in a tarpaulin hat and long
rubber boots, with his belt stuck full of
Fourth-of-July pistols, that Aunt Clare almost
trembled. “Silence, till our Captain speaks!”
he commanded.</p>

<p>There was no captain in sight, but presently
there was a sound of scratching, puffing, snorting
in the chimney. The pirate captain, like
Santa Claus, was coming down from the roof.</p>

<p>There was a slip and a rattle of stones, and
with a thump he tumbled into the middle of
the cave. It was not quite the entrance he
had planned, and the first word of the chief
was an “Ow!” of pain. For a minute he did
not rise, but sat rubbing some injured spot
upon his person. Then he reached for his
sword, which he had lost in the fall, and
sprang fiercely to his feet, a majestic figure
(Charlie was a tall boy for ten years).</p>

<p>The pirate chief wore a great slouch hat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
pulled down over his mask, below which hung
a beard of curly black wool. A yellow handkerchief
was knotted about his throat. He
wore a red sweater, with a skull and crossbones
on the breast, fringed leggings, and his belt
bristled with knives, daggers, and pistols, to say
nothing of the huge tin sword which he brandished
fiercely. He truly was a terrible figure.
Little Jane trembled and clung close to Sue
when he hissed through his teeth:—</p>

<p>“Well, my hearties, whom have we here?
Bulldog Bill thirsts for vengeance and for
gold!”</p>

<p>“Captain,” said Bloody Dick, “these are
land-lubbers who were coming to our cave.
We have captured them and their treasure,
which looks valuable. What shall we do with
them?”</p>

<p>“Let the prisoners die,” said the captain, in
a blood-curdling voice. “Let them walk the
plank; but we will keep the treasure.”</p>

<p>With a scream Aunt Clare threw herself
on her knees before the pirate captain. “Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
good Captain Bulldog,” she said, “spare us!
we are so young and innocent. One of us has
a dear little baby at home who will feel so
sad to lose us! Take our treasure, if you will,
but spare our lives. Yonder coffee-pot is solid
tin, and so are the knives and spoons. Let
such a prize content you!”</p>

<p>Aunt Clare pretended to cry so pitifully that
the three smallest pirates began to boohoo
with sympathy, until Slippery Dick whispered:—</p>

<p>“Sh! You kids! She’s only pretending.
Don’t you know it’s all play?”</p>

<p>Bulldog Bill listened to the prisoner’s words,
but shook his head. “It is not enough,” he
said. “What will you do for us besides?”</p>

<p>“We will be your slaves,” said Aunt Clare.
“We will prepare your dinner.”</p>

<p>Still the captain shook his head. “Can’t
you do something else?” he asked.</p>

<p>Aunt Clare had an idea. “I will tell you
a story,” she said.</p>

<p>“Ha! that is good!” exclaimed the captain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
“You shall tell us a tale, but it must be one
that we have never heard before. If you do
this we will set you free.”</p>

<p>“Give me time to think, and I will promise
to tell you a tale which you never heard
before,” said Aunt Clare.</p>

<p>“Very good,” growled Bulldog Bill. “Loose
the prisoners’ bonds so that they can prepare
our meal. But guard them well so that they
cannot escape.”</p>

<p>Bloody Dick and Slippery Joe untied the
prisoners’ hands, while the other pirates
guarded the entrance of the cave.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” said the pirate captain, “we
are hungry. Let us dine at once. Prisoners,
prepare the food!”</p>

<p>“It is too early for luncheon,” said Mrs.
Thornton. But the pirates began to clamor.
Aunt Clare sided with them.</p>

<p>“Let them have their way,” she begged.
“Hungry pirates are very dangerous! Besides,
I confess that I am half starved myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, we must have a fire,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Mrs. Thornton. “Who will gather wood for
the fire?”</p>

<p>“Let the four youngest pirates do that,”
said the captain. So Jane, Bill, Bob, and Rose
went out to hunt for driftwood on the beach.
Presently they were running in and out like
ants, bringing it by armfuls.</p>

<p>“We must have water,” said Mrs. Thornton.
“Who will go to the spring for it?”</p>

<p>“Let me go,” said Sue.</p>

<p>“No, the jug will be heavy. Let Slippery
Joe fetch the water,” commanded the captain.
So Slippery Joe went forth. “We others
will examine the treasure,” said the captain.
The remaining four, Charlie, Kenneth, Mary,
and Sue, sat down on the ground and began
to unpack the baskets which had come in the
boat. And as they unwrapped one after another
of the good things, they smacked their
lips and squealed with delight. They were so
interested in the treasure that they forgot all
about their prisoners. But suddenly they heard
a shout from outside the cave:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“Catch him! He’s running away!”</p>

<p>The pirates jumped to their feet. Mrs.
Thornton was bending over the fire, doing
things with the coffee-pot, and Aunt Clare
was taking the lobsters to pieces. But Mr.
Thornton had disappeared.</p>

<p>Bulldog Bill and his men rushed to the door
echoing the shout of “Catch him! catch him!”
When they were outside they saw the four
other pirates racing along the beach towards
the spot where the runaway was disappearing
over the top of the cliff. The whole band
started in pursuit, leaving Mama and Aunt
Clare quite alone; so that these prisoners might
have escaped, too, had they tried. But they
were so interested in preparing dinner that
they forgot all about it. Just like women!</p>

<p>After a long time the pirates returned,
flushed, panting, and tired, but without their
prisoner.</p>

<p>“Papa ran so fast we could not catch him,”
explained Rose to her Mama. “He ran away
into the woods, and we couldn’t find him. Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Mama! I’m afraid now he won’t be here for
dinner!” Rose looked distressed.</p>

<p>“Silence, Burly Ben!” said the captain
sternly. “This is no fit talk for one of Bulldog
Bill’s bloody band!—My! how good
that cocoa smells! Is dinner almost ready,
Aunt Clare? I never was so hungry in my
life. Can’t I have just one little lobster claw
to chew?”</p>

<p>Aunt Clare had not spread the tablecloth
in the cave, for that would have been too dark
and too crowded for every one to be comfortable.
But the flat rock out in front of the cave
made a fine table, with room for every one
to sit cross-legged around it in pirate fashion.
Each person had a big, round scallop-shell for
a plate, with a tin cup of cocoa beside it, and
such a lovely luncheon was spread on the white
cloth as the little Prouts at least had never before
seen. They all sat down together, prisoners
and pirates, and the pirates forgot for a
time that they were anything but hungry girls
and boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“It is too bad that Papa isn’t here,” said
Mrs. Thornton.</p>

<p>“Too bad!” echoed Kenneth and Rose
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>But before many minutes they heard a sound
of some one scrambling down the cliff close
by, and presently Mr. Thornton himself crept
sheepishly up to the group.</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. Pirate Captain,” he said,
“may I come back to dinner? When I ran
away I forgot about Aunt Clare’s story. I
don’t mind starving to death, as I came very
near doing on this desert island, but I could
not bear to lose the story. Let me dine and
hear the tale, then I will walk the plank
gladly.”</p>

<p>“Have you any ransom?” asked the pirate
chief, taking a huge bite of sandwich.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton slapped his pockets doubtfully.
Then his face brightened. “Yes! I do
happen to have one bit of treasure about me
which you did not take away,” he said. “You
forgot, I think, to go through my pockets.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>He drew out a bag of peanuts and handed
it to Bulldog Bill, then seized a sandwich in
each hand. “Fair exchange!” he cried. The
children set up a shout of delight.</p>

<p>“It is a good treasure,” said Bulldog Bill
approvingly, as he helped himself.</p>

<p>“I would have starved rather than eat
them,” said Mr. Thornton, with a sad voice.
“I bought them as a present for my innocent
children at home. But since I have fallen into
the power of this pirate crew you must do with
them as you think best.”</p>

<p>Now the pirates knew what it was best to
do with peanuts; and they did it. When
every one had eaten all he possibly could, the
captain suddenly remembered that he was a
pirate. He put on his tarpaulin hat, and seizing
his sword, said sternly to Aunt Clare:—</p>

<p>“It is now time for the story. Prisoner,
begin; but beware how you tell us one which
we have heard before. If it is a chestnut you
shall die.”</p>

<p>“Fierce Captain,” said Aunt Clare, “did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
you ever hear the tale called ‘The Pirate
Hoard’?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Captain Bulldog, “I never did.
Has any one here ever heard this tale?” And
every one answered, “No!”</p>

<p>“I thought not,” said Aunt Clare.</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the captain; “go on with
the story.”</p>

<p>And this is the story which Aunt Clare
told.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>THE PIRATE HOARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS is a story of Captain Kidd, who
was, you know, the greatest pirate of
them all in old times.</p>

<p>One day this terrible fellow was cruising
about in these very waters, with a ship full of
gold and jewels and precious things which he
had stolen. You see, he wanted to find a new
place in which to bury this particular treasure.
He was always hiding things. He buried his
different hoards all along the coast from Maine
to Mexico, just as squirrels hide their nuts
wherever it is convenient. You can scarcely
find any place, however tiny, which has not
a story that Captain Kidd’s treasure is buried
somewhere near. Like the squirrels, Captain
Kidd often went away and forgot about his
treasure, and never returned to dig it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>Well, Captain Kidd was cruising along this
coast, with his ship full of treasure. He had
been enjoying great luck on his last voyage.
That means, of course, that a great many
other people had been most unlucky. In those
days about the unluckiest thing that could
happen to anybody was to meet Captain Kidd
on the high seas. Pirates were such greedy,
cruel fellows,—I beg your pardon! I forgot
that nearly every one here is a pirate. How
careless of me!</p>

<p>Captain Kidd was a long way from shore
when he ran into a fog,—a thick Maine fog;
the kind that Islanders know so well. It was
so thick that one could scarcely see a ship’s
length ahead. All of a sudden the pirate lookout
called to the captain:—</p>

<p>“Sail ahead!” and sure enough! out of
the fog loomed a sailing vessel, so near that
the two bowsprits were almost touching.</p>

<p>Now, this stranger was a fishing-boat named
the Mary Ann. She was a Maine fishing-boat,
like your father’s, Tom Prout, and she was on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
her way home from the Banks with a cargo
of fish. The captain, whose name was Tobey,
was frightened out of his wits when he saw
the black flag flying at the mast of Captain
Kidd’s vessel. Of course, he knew what this
meant. If he were captured by the pirate ship
he should never see his home and dear little
children again. So he put about, and the Mary
Ann scuttled away for dear life, without stopping
to say “Howdy.”</p>

<p>When Captain Kidd saw the other boat go
about, he grinned a dreadful grin and said,—</p>

<p>“Oho! You are running away, are you?
Well, that must mean that you have some precious
treasure aboard. Let’s after them, my
hearties, and give them a chase.”</p>

<p>You see, he was greedy as well as cruel.
Already he had more treasure than he knew
what to do with, but he longed for more.
This was just like a pirate—I beg your pardon,
Captain Bulldog! I forgot again.</p>

<p>Now began an exciting chase through the
fog. The little Mary Ann was a fast boat, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
for a time she kept ahead of the pirate ship,
which could barely see her scudding like a
sea-gull through the fog. But finally poor
Captain Tobey saw that the pirate ship was
gaining on him, and his heart sank. Alas!
what could he do? He thought of his children
at home, and the tears filled his eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly he had an idea! He knew every
rock and shoal in the bay, which was full of
rocks and shoals. He remembered that there
must be a reef close by, a reef which came almost
to the surface of the sea. Until one was
quite close he would not see it, hidden by
this fog. Captain Tobey steered straight for
the place where he knew that reef must be,
straight to a froth of white foam.</p>

<p>The pirate ship followed where he led
and came on, gaining every minute. Now
Captain Tobey held his breath. They were
in the waves that broke upon the reef! But
the Mary Ann went safely over without touching,
because she was so small. And the big
vessel flying the black flag came close after her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span><i>Crash! Smash!</i> “Hurrah!” came a shout
from the Mary Ann. “Hurrah! Good-by!”
The pirate ship was stuck fast on the reef,
and the waves were beating her to pieces. But
Captain Tobey did not wait to see what happened.
He was too eager to get home to his
wife and babies. The Mary Ann disappeared
silently through the fog, scudding towards a
harbor miles away.</p>

<p>But there was excitement indeed on board
the pirate ship. The pirates went running
to and fro, shouting and waving their arms,
crazy with fear. They tumbled into the long
boats as fast as they could, without thinking
anything about their treasure, only of their
precious lives. But Captain Kidd was different.
He cared more for his treasure than for anything.</p>

<p>“The mate and I will shift for ourselves!”
he shouted. “Leave my boat!” He knew he
could not save everything, there was such a
vast deal of gold and silver and heavy plate
in the ship. But he ran to his own cabin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
brought out a little wooden box bound in
iron. It was full of the most precious treasure
of all,—diamonds and rubies, sapphires and
emeralds, and precious stones of every color.</p>

<p>With this chest under his cloak he got into
the boat, and his mate, One-Eyed Pete, rowed
him away. The fog was so thick that they soon
lost sight of the other boat. A storm was rising;
the wind blew so loud and the waves
roared so terribly that they could not hear
any answer to their calls. They had to be very
careful of the rocks and reefs on which the
waves broke fiercely, and they rowed on and
on for hours before they found a place where
they could land.</p>

<p>But at last they came to a safer shore, with
an inlet and a smooth beach. They landed,
and soon discovered that this was a very little
desert island.</p>

<p>“This will be just the place to bury the
treasure,” said Captain Kidd. “Let us do so
before we meet any one who may try to take
it from us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Right, Captain,” growled One-Eyed Pete.</p>

<p>So they dug a hole in the ground and buried
the treasure, heaping a little mound over it.
They knew that they should remember the
spot, because there was close beside it a great
big rock split open and lying in two pieces
side by side, like a huge book spread flat upon
its back.</p>

<p>Captain Kidd wrote down in his note-book
a description of the place, and, as well as he
knew, how they had come there. He drew
besides a picture of the fog as a sample, so that
he should recognize it again. For he said,—“I
never saw such fog before, in all my life!”
Which proves that all this must have happened
close by where we are now.</p>

<p>Then One-Eyed Pete said,—“Cap’n, a
terrible storm is coming on, and I think this
here island is a poor place to be on; for the
waves will roll right over it. Let’s row to the
mainland, which can’t be far away.”</p>

<p>So they rowed away again, and after a long
time spent in trying to find a landing-place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
they came to a harbor and a village. They
pretended that they were shipwrecked sailors,
so the good people took them in and gave
them food. What would they have thought
had they known it was the wicked Captain
Kidd who was visiting them!</p>

<p>The storm lasted several days, but when
it was over Captain Kidd said “good-by”
politely, and with One-Eyed Pete went out
on the first fishing-boat that left the harbor.
Nobody discovered who they were. They exchanged
passage into the first vessel they met,
and were soon far over the seas.</p>

<p>After that Captain Kidd lived to have many
wild adventures, and he forgot all about his
treasure in the little iron-bound box on the
desert Island. No one ever heard of the other
pirates, who must have been drowned in the
storm that night. The pirate ship went to
pieces, and some bits of the treasure were
washed ashore with its timbers, and the fishermen’s
children found them on the beach.
But it is not known that any one ever found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
the captain’s jewels, and I dare say the box is
there to this day. Just think, if only one could
find it!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Aunt Clare ended her story with a sigh,
echoed by all the little girls. “I wish I had
some diamonds now,” said Rose wistfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, so do I,—and rubies!” cried Mary.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” asked Kenneth and Charlie,
in one breath.</p>

<p>“Is it true?” demanded Tom eagerly.</p>

<p>“’Course it is true,” cried Charlie. “Didn’t
you ever hear of Captain Kidd?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know for certain that it is all true,”
said Aunt Clare, “but it <i>might</i> be. There were
pirates who buried their treasure in desert islands.
Why, I’ve heard the fishermen of this
very place tell that there was treasure buried
around here somewhere. No one knows
where.”</p>

<p>“It might be this very same treasure!” cried
Kenneth, “mightn’t it, Aunt Clare?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“I suppose it might,” she answered, laughing.</p>

<p>The boys exchanged eager looks. They did
not say anything about it then, but they each
knew that they were resolved to find that
pirate treasure if it was anywhere near the
Island.</p>

<p>As for the little girls, they were helping to
pack up the lunch baskets; for the released
prisoners were now ready to go home, and
some of the pirates were going with them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>TREASURE TROVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE morning, about a week later, three of
the pirates—Tom, Charlie, and Kenneth—got
into a dory and rowed away from
the harbor. It was Tom’s own boat, of which
he was very proud. He had spent all his life
near and in and on the water, and he was a
splendid boatman. Mr. Thornton was not
afraid to let the children go with him in his
dory, but he made them promise that never
more than two should go with Tom at one
time.</p>

<p>The pirates had with them in the boat three
spades; they looked very sly, as though they
were upon a secret errand. Tom was the leader
in this adventure, and he seemed to know just
where to go. They rowed around the Point
and then straight out into the bay towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
a little rocky island, beyond the other islands.
They followed the shore of it until
they came to an inlet with a smooth beach
beyond.</p>

<p>“This is the place,” said Tom, jumping
out and pulling up the boat. “Come on, fellows!”</p>

<p>He raced up the beach followed by the
other two, and climbed a bank. At the top
was a spring of cool, clear water under a tree,
and close beside it was a huge rock.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” cried Tom, pointing at the
rock. “What do you think of that?”</p>

<p>The rock was split into two flat pieces, each
almost square, which lay side by side. It looked
like a great book spread open.</p>

<p>“It is the very rock that Aunt Clare told
about in the story!” cried Charlie.</p>

<p>“Where is the mound?” asked Kenneth
eagerly. “Oh, I see! This must be it.”</p>

<p>Sure enough! Close beside the rock and
near the spring the ground swelled into a
mound covered with grass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“Of course this must be the place,” said
Charlie excitedly. “How did you ever find it,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“Well, when she was telling the story I
remembered this island, and I thought it was
just the place that the pirates would have
come to first when they drifted in from sea; so
I rowed over to look at it. I found the cove
was just as she had said, and sure enough!
there was the rock like a big book, and the
mound. I knew this must be the place. I
wanted to begin to dig right away, but I
thought it wouldn’t be fair without you fellows,
’cause you were the ones to tell me about
pirates first.”</p>

<p>“Let’s begin to dig now,” said Kenneth
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Let’s!” cried Charlie. So they ran down
to the dory and got their spades. Then they
all fell to work.</p>

<p>The mound was not hard like ordinary
earth. When they had gone through the sod
their spades struck something queer. Charlie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
took some of it up in his hand. “Why, it’s
broken shells,” he said.</p>

<p>“Clam shells!” exclaimed Kenneth, picking
up two which were still unbroken. “The
pirates must have had clams for their dinner,
and have piled the shells on top of their treasure.
Oh, hurry! this <i>proves</i> there is something
here, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>Eagerly they set to work again. It was
amazing to see what a number of shells there
were in that mound. It was made of nothing
else. Down, down they dug until they had a
hole as large as Tom’s body. But still there
was no sign of any treasure. Their spades tossed
up broken shells and nothing more.</p>

<p>“My! Those two pirates must have had a
big clambake all by themselves,” said Charlie,
pausing to wipe his streaming forehead.</p>

<p>“I suppose Captain Kidd was an awful
eater,” said Kenneth. “But I say, how could
they finish so many clams?”</p>

<p>“Huh! I could eat half a barrel of steamed
clams any day,” protested Tom. “Those two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
pirates were regular cannibals, I expect. Besides,
they were eating on purpose to have
shells enough to cover the treasure, don’t you
see?”</p>

<p>Once more they fell to work, and they
dug for ten minutes without a word. But
presently, with a sigh, they all three stopped
again. It was a hot day and this was hard
work.</p>

<p>“If we find the treasure we must give some
to the girls,” said Kenneth.</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Tom. “They are pirates,
too. The band will all have to share.”</p>

<p>“Let’s give each of the others three diamonds
and three rubies and three sapphires
and three emeralds,” said Charlie, with sudden
inspiration.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Tom and Kenneth.
“And we’ll divide the rest equally among us
three,” added Kenneth.</p>

<p>Then they began work again. But still there
was no sign of that iron-bound box. Their
arms were growing very tired. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
almost ready to give it up. Suddenly Kenneth
stooped and picked up something.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he said. “What’s this?”</p>

<p>It was a small pointed stone, flat on both
sides. The other two boys examined it eagerly.
“Why, it looks like an Indian arrowhead,”
said Charlie; “but how came it here?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the pirates used bows and arrows
too,” suggested Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” cried Kenneth. “I’m almost
sure they did. I remember once seeing an old
picture of men fighting with bows and arrows,
and they were not Indians. They must have
been pirates. Hurrah! I guess we are near the
treasure now!”</p>

<p>They dug down with new energy, tossing
up the shell-earth like beavers. Presently
Charlie stooped. “I’ve found something too,”
he said; “but I don’t know what it is.” It
was a curious round stone, hollow and smooth
in the middle.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Tom stooped also.
“Here’s something else,” he said, pulling out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
a very long, three-sided stone roughly sharpened
on one edge. “What do you suppose this
is?”</p>

<p>“Maybe it is an anchor,” suggested Kenneth.
But it did not look much like an anchor.
They worked for another ten minutes, then
they stopped, for nothing else came to light.</p>

<p>“I don’t think these are much,” said
Charlie, kicking the stone things with his foot.
“I don’t believe there is anything else here.
These old shells go down and down,—to
China, I guess. The pirates couldn’t have
eaten so many clams, you know. Let’s give
it up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s,” agreed Kenneth, tossing away
his spade and sitting down to rest. “I’m tired
and I’m not going to dig any more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come! Don’t give up so soon!”
begged Tom. “I’m going to work awhile
longer.”</p>

<p>Charlie looked at his watch. “It is noon
already,” he said. “I’m hungry, and Aunt
Mollie doesn’t like us to be late for dinner.
Let’s go home. There isn’t anything here
but old stone things, and they are no good.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i099.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">TOM, CHARLIE, AND KENNETH DIG FOR THE TREASURE</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“The pirates left them,” said Tom doggedly.
“I’m going to work a little longer.
Say, will you fellows dig for ten minutes more?
Then if we don’t find anything I’ll agree to
give it up.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the other two.</p>

<p>Once more they set to work with tired arms.
They dug and they dug through the dust of
broken clam shells, of which there seemed
to be no end. But still there was no sign of
the iron-bound box. It was very discouraging.
All they found was a few more arrowheads
and some knobby stones with grooves about
the top. They were hardly worth picking up,
it seemed. The boys tossed them aside in a
little heap with the other stone things. Then
they threw down their spades, rubbing their
aching backs and arms. All these pains for
nothing!</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” said Charlie. “There can’t
be anything here. We shall have to give it up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“It is long after dinner time. Perhaps we
shan’t get any, and they will scold us,” said
Kenneth ruefully.</p>

<p>“Huh! Only a lot of old stone things!”
growled Tom, kicking the heap spitefully.
“They aren’t worth taking home, are they?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! We must show them all to
father. Perhaps he can tell us what they are,”
said Kenneth.</p>

<p>“Well, come on, then,” urged Charlie. “I
wish we had gone an hour ago. I hate cold
dinners. Oh, what a wasted morning!”</p>

<p>Tom lingered wistfully. “It looks just like
a treasure place,” he said, “and I felt somehow
as if we should find it here. There must
be some mistake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, Tom!” called the others
impatiently; and he hurried down to the beach
where they had carried the stone things. Soon
they were rowing back to their own island.
But they were very silent and sulky all the
way. Their treasure hunt had not been a success,
and they were hungry and cross. Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
was the gloomiest of the three. He felt that
they blamed him for their disappointment.
But it had mattered most to him.</p>

<p>“I wanted to take home a handful of diamonds
to Mary,” he said to himself. “How
pleased she would be! Then we would all be
rich. But I would give the handsomest diamond
of all to Rose.”</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton was on the beach looking for
them when they came in. He had been greatly
worried because they had been gone so long;
but he did not scold them when they told him
what they had been doing.</p>

<p>“Tom thought that he had found Captain
Kidd’s hiding-place, Papa,” said Kenneth
wearily. “It looked just like the mound that
Aunt Clare told us about; but there wasn’t
any treasure at all, only some old stone things
in a heap of shells.”</p>

<p>“Stone things in a shell-heap?” asked Mr.
Thornton, pricking up his ears. “What do you
mean by that?”</p>

<p>“We brought these home, Uncle Jack,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
said Charlie, pulling out the stone things from
under the seat of the dory.</p>

<p>“Hello! Some good Indian arrowheads and
sinkers; a stone mortar for grinding corn; and
this,—why! this is as fine an Indian plow
as I ever saw. Which of you found this, boys?”
cried Mr. Thornton excitedly.</p>

<p>“Tom found that,” said Kenneth without
envy.</p>

<p>“Well, Tom, I must buy this of you. Boys,
you have found a treasure indeed, though it is
not the kind you were looking for. You must
have come upon an Indian shell-mound, and I
dare say there are still more things there to be
discovered. But come now, you must be half
starved. I know Mama and Aunt Clare are
very anxious,—I dare say Tom’s mother is
not the worrying kind. Let’s all go home and
have some cold dinner. Then we will look at
your treasures again. Tom, you ought to be
proud of your morning’s work! I wish I had
discovered that shell-mound myself!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE BOX OF CANDY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALTHOUGH the boys had been disappointed
in the kind of treasure which
they had found, the Indian relics proved a real
treasure, after all. The next day Mr. Thornton
went over to the island with them, and
they brought back a few more stone things
from the mound, but nothing so fine as Tom’s
plow. However, Mr. Thornton said that
there might be other interesting things there
which they could dig up when they chose.</p>

<p>Mr. Thornton was so pleased with the boys’
discovery that he paid Kenneth and Charlie
each two dollars for their share of the treasure.
But he gave Tom five dollars to pay for his
plow and for first discovering the mound,
which had once been an Indian picnic-place.
He said these relics should be used to start an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Island museum, to match the Island library.
And perhaps some day they would find other
things to make the collection more complete.</p>

<p>Tom felt very rich indeed. He had never
owned so much money in all his life, and he
could not decide what to do with it. There
are so many things which one can do with
five dollars, especially if one is a boy. But he
resolved not to be in a hurry to spend it.</p>

<p>There was a famous professor staying at the
hotel on the other end of the Island, and
one day Mr. Thornton said to Kenneth and
Charlie:—</p>

<p>“Boys, I want to take your Indian relics
over to the hotel and show them to the Professor.
I should like to know what he thinks
of them. Shall we get Tom and row around
there?”</p>

<p>Of course, the boys were delighted to go.
They had not been to the hotel that summer,
and usually there were some interesting puppies
in the stable. They found Tom and his
dory, and presently they were on their way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
When they reached the hotel Mr. Thornton
went to find the Professor, while the boys
started to look for the puppies. But as they
went past the piazza they heard the hotel
keeper talking to a group of ladies.</p>

<p>“No, there is not a mosquito on the Island,”
he asserted. “That is one of the things of
which we are most proud. I will give a five-pound
box of the very best candy to any one
who will find a mosquito on this Island.”</p>

<p>The three boys smacked their lips. “Did
you hear that? Um! I’d like that box of
candy,” sighed Charlie. “I haven’t had any
for weeks.”</p>

<p>“Five pounds of candy all at once!” cried
Tom. “I never had so much in all my life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have,” said Kenneth, “at Christmas
time. My! Isn’t it good! I wish I could find
that mosquito; but I suppose no one will.
There isn’t one on the Island, is there, Tom?
You ought to know.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Tom. “I never saw one here.
I am sure there isn’t one”—He stopped short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
with a sudden wicked idea. “There might be,
though,” he added under his breath.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t buy five pounds of very best
candy with my two dollars, could I, Charlie?”
asked Kenneth.</p>

<p>“No; but Tom could with his five, if he
wanted to spend the money so,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to spend the money so,”
said Tom almost crossly. But how he did long
for that candy! The boys did not understand
what made him act so queer. He paid very
little attention to the five lovely puppies in the
stable. Even when Mr. Thornton came with
the Professor, who told them how proud they
ought to feel because they had found such an
interesting shell-mound, praising Tom especially,
he did not seem to care. All the way
home he spoke scarcely a word. He was thinking
of something very different from what the
others were saying.</p>

<p>When they reached the Cove the boys asked
Tom to come and play pirate after dinner. But
Tom said:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“No, I’m going to be busy this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to hunt for more treasure?”
asked Mr. Thornton, laughing. Tom
looked queer, but shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “I’ve—I’ve got an errand
to attend to.” And that was all he had to say.</p>

<p>After dinner Tom rowed away all alone out
into the bay, and he was gone until supper
time. When he came back he pulled his boat
up on the beach and fumbled in his pocket.
He was looking for something so very small
that at first he thought he had lost it. But
no,—there it was, all right. It was a tiny
pill box. Tom took off the cover and looked
in, grinning to himself. He seemed pleased
with his day’s work.</p>

<p>At the supper table Tom’s mother suddenly
bent forward and looked at his face sharply.
“Why, Tom!” she said. “Where have you
been to get all bitten up so? You are covered
with mosquito bites! You never got them
around here. You must have been over to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Mouse Island. There are lots of mosquitoes in
the swamp there.”</p>

<p>Tom turned very red. “Yes, I rowed over
to Mouse—this morning. There were two
young fish-hawks in the nest on the old pine
tree,” he said briefly.</p>

<p>“Did the other boys go with you?” asked
his mother.</p>

<p>“No; I went all alone,” he answered, bending
his face low over his plate. And then the
children began to chatter about something else,
for which Tom was glad.</p>

<p>The next morning Tom took his dory and
rowed around the Island to the hotel. When
he came up to the piazza he found Mr. Smith,
the hotel man, talking to a group of ladies,
just as he had been doing the day before. Tom
took off his cap politely, and said:—</p>

<p>“Good-morning, sir. I’d like to speak
with you.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Mr. Smith. “You are one
of the Island boys, aren’t you? Well, what
do you want with me, my hearty?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Tom drew something out of his pocket and
handed it to Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>“What’s this? A pill box!” said Mr.
Smith, greatly puzzled. “I don’t want any
pills!” All the ladies smiled.</p>

<p>“There’s a mosquito inside, sir,” said Tom.
“I heard what you said yesterday: that you’d
give a box of candy to any one who would
bring you a mosquito; so I found one for
you. He’s dead, sir,” he added reassuringly,
as Mr. Smith hesitated about taking off the
cover of the pill box.</p>

<p>There was a chorus of laughs at the expression
on Mr. Smith’s face; but finally he
decided to smile. “Well, I am surprised and
shocked,” he said. “I could have declared solemnly
that there was not a wicked mosquito
on this island. But I will wager that this is the
only one.”</p>

<p>“Better not make any more rash offers,
Mr. Smith,” said one of the girls. “You may
have to pay for more candy than you bargain
for. We will all set out to hunt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“No, I don’t repeat my offer,” said Mr.
Smith hastily. “But I suppose I must pay my
debt to our friend here. You come around
to-morrow morning, Sonny,” he said to Tom,
“and get your candy. I’ll send to the city for
it by Captain Sackett.”</p>

<p>“Smart boy, isn’t he?” said one lady to
another, as Tom went away. “He has such an
honest face.”</p>

<p>Tom heard her words, and his ears turned
red. But as he rowed home he thought triumphantly,
“How good that candy will be!”
and he smacked his lips.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE OUTLAW</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">YES, it was fine candy! Tom thought he
had never tasted anything half so good,
as he took the first nibble. For Mr. Smith kept
his promise, and the candy came safely in Captain
Sackett’s care. Five pounds in a beautiful
pink box tied with gold string!</p>

<p>Tom was eager to share it with his brothers
and sisters and with the other pirates; for he
was a generous boy.</p>

<p>“I’ll give them a surprise!” he said,
chuckling to himself as he rowed home from
the hotel. He knew where he should find the
band, for Mary had said that they were all
going that morning to play in the pirate
cave. So he did not go straight home, but
rowed on around the Point. He beached his
boat before any one heard him, and ran up
towards the cave, giving a loud war-whoop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“Hello! where is everybody?” he cried.</p>

<p>The pirates came running from every direction.
“Here’s Tom!” cried Mary. “Oh,
Tom! Where have you been?”</p>

<p>“Welcome, Slippery Joe,” said the chief.
“Have you had an adventure?”</p>

<p>“I have captured some treasure,” said Tom,
grinning. “Look here!” and he held up the
box of candy.</p>

<p>“Candy!” A shout of joy arose, and the
pirates surrounded him eagerly.</p>

<p>“It’s share alike,” said Tom. “I have
eaten only one piece so far.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom! how good of you!” cried
Rose. “It is real city candy and must have
cost a lot of money. Did you buy it with
your five dollars?”</p>

<p>“I know! I know!” shouted Kenneth.
“He found the mosquito; didn’t you,
Tom?”</p>

<p>Tom nodded. “Yes, I found him and got
the prize.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean about a mosquito?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
“Tell us about it!” begged the pirates. So
they all sat down in a circle, each one munching
a delicious bit of candy, while Tom told
about Mr. Smith’s offer, which Charlie and
Kenneth knew already.</p>

<p>“I believed that there wasn’t any use in
trying,” said Kenneth. “You thought yourself
that there wasn’t a single mosquito on
the Island; didn’t you, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I know I thought so,” began Tom,
“but”—He was interrupted by Susan.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know where he found it!” she
said. “He went over to Mouse Island the
other day. There are lots of mosquitoes there.
He was all covered with bites when he came
back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that wasn’t fair!” cried Rose;
“that was cheating. Oh, Tom!” She put
back the piece of candy which she had taken
as the box was passed around the circle for the
second time.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Tom turned red
and looked sulky. “What’s the use of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
fussy? I’m a pirate, anyway,” he said. “Aren’t
we all pirates?”</p>

<p>Charlie and Kenneth looked at each other,
then Charlie spoke like the chief of the band:
“That wasn’t playing, Tom,” he said; “that
was a <i>real</i> lie. We aren’t going to play that
way, if I am captain. We aren’t going to
tell any lies. Here! take your old candy. We
don’t want any of it. Put it back!” he commanded
the others. And reluctantly they all
did as Rose had done.</p>

<p>“Ho! all right!” said Tom, jumping to his
feet angrily. “If you don’t want any, I guess
I can manage to worry it down. But you are
awful sillies. I won’t belong to your old band!”
and he flounced out of the cave with the box
of candy under his arm. So Tom became an
outlaw.</p>

<p>Tom munched away at his candy all by
himself, and tried to pretend that he enjoyed it
very much. But somehow it was not as good
as he had expected. The emptier the box became
the less he cared for the candy, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
was a very odd thing. Usually, as every one
knows, unless one gobbles it all at once like a
little pig, the candy grows better and better,
until when there are only a few pieces left it
is so perfectly delicious that one cannot bear to
think of its disappearing altogether. Before
the box was half finished Tom was heartily
tired of it. When the last piece was gone he
took the box out in his dory, threw it overboard,
and smashed it viciously with his oar.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to see any more candy as long
as I live!” he said. But this was a week later.</p>

<p>All this time Tom had been an outlaw.
He would not play with the other children,
not even with his brothers and sisters; for he
thought that they were all in league against
him. He thought they were all disloyal. He
had meant to be generous, and share his candy
with them; but they had looked at it in a
different way. How silly it was to pretend
that he was not playing pirate fairly! Why,
pirates did much worse things than that! He
had never thought till now that it was mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
to tell a lie; but when he remembered how
shocked Rose had looked, Tom turned very
red. That was hardest of all to bear,—that
Rose should think him mean.</p>

<p>Tom wondered if any one would tell his
father and mother. But no one did. The pirate
captain had made his band promise not to be
“telltales.” Tom did not know this, however,
and at every meal-time he eyed his brothers
and sisters suspiciously, waiting to see what
would happen.</p>

<p>His mother said sometimes, “How queer
you act nowadays, Tom! What is the matter
with you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Tom would answer sulkily;
and as soon as he could leave the table he
would go off by himself.</p>

<p>The pirate band was sadly broken. Mary
felt so sorry about Tom, who would not let
her talk to him, that she stayed at home and
cried a good deal. Except Sue, the other little
Prouts would not go anywhere without Mary.
Sue was the only one who went to Sweetbrier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Cottage. But Charlie and Kenneth said it was
no fun playing pirate without more boys. So
they went off by themselves, while Sue and
Rose played dolls in Beech House. Nobody
was so happy as before that unlucky mosquito
had spoiled everything.</p>

<p>All this while Tom had plenty of time to
think. Somehow things looked different to
him now. Gradually he had been making up
his mind.</p>

<p>One day he got into his dory and rowed
around the Island to the end where the hotel
stood. As usual there was a crowd upon the
piazza, with Mr. Smith in the midst. Tom
thought it was the largest crowd he had ever
seen. He hung back and hesitated at first, but
finally he screwed up his courage. He went
straight to the hotel man and stood twirling
his cap uneasily. Then he spoke quickly:—</p>

<p>“I have come to tell you, sir, that I didn’t
play fair about that mosquito. I knew what
you said was true, and that there wasn’t one
on the Island; so I went over to Mouse, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
there are a plenty, and I caught one there. It
was a lie, and I am sorry. I have just five dollars,—I
guess that will pay for the candy.
Here it is, sir.” And he thrust into the hand
of the amazed Mr. Smith the bill which Mr.
Thornton had given him to pay for his share
in the pirate treasure.</p>

<p>“Hold on! Stop!” cried Mr. Smith, as
Tom darted away. But he soon saw that it
was no use for a little fat man like him to try
to catch Tom, who had the start. So he sat
down again, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“I don’t even know his name!” he said,
looking helplessly at the bill in his hand. “But
this relieves my mind very much. I am greatly
pleased, ladies, that you have this assurance that
our Island is without mosquitoes.”</p>

<p>“He was a brave boy to confess before us
all,” said one of the ladies. “I like his face.
I wish we knew who he is.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Mr. Smith. “I must find
out.”</p>

<small>GULL ROCK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SUSAN and Rose were tired of playing dolls
in Beech House all by themselves.</p>

<p>“Let’s not play this any more,” said Rose.
“Sue, let us go and look for that treasure, the
<i>real</i> treasure, which the boys could not find.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Sue. “Let’s!”</p>

<p>They ran along the cliff until they came to
the bathing beach, then they climbed down
to the sand.</p>

<p>“I know where I think the treasure is,”
said Rose. “I think it is out there on that great
big pile of rock where the gulls are. I have
always wanted to go out on those rocks, but
sometimes one can’t go, because there is water
all around them. See, we could go now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Susan. “I never was out there
either. Let’s go!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>This stony point, of which Rose spoke, was
called Gull Rock. It rose gray and jagged out
of the sea, looking like a castle of stone. It
was a favorite resting-place of the sea-gulls.
Great flocks of them wheeled and screamed
around the rocks and settled on them in gray
clouds. There was a narrow pathway of stones
which led out to Gull Rock, and on each side
of the path the waves lapped gently. The tide
was coming in.</p>

<p>“Let’s take off our shoes and stockings,”
said Rose. So they did. “Now, follow my
leader!” Rose cried; and with much squealing
and giggling the little girls began to hop
from stone to stone along the narrow path.
It was very exciting! They kept tumbling
down, for the rocks were wet and slippery,
and in some places were covered with seaweed,
which as every one knows is the slitheriest
kind of thing under foot! Sometimes their feet
went <i>splash!</i> into the pools of water which
stood here and there on the path. But they did
not mind that, because their feet were bare.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i123.jpg" alt=""></div>
<p class="caption">ROSE AND SUE CROSS UPON THE SLIPPERY STONES</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>At last they came to Gull Rock. They
climbed up to the top. My! how surprised the
sea-gulls were when the two little heads appeared
above the edge of the rock, and how
fast they flapped away, chattering and screaming
hard things about these uninvited guests!</p>

<p>“It was too bad to disturb them,” said Rose,
who always meant to be polite to animals and
birds. “But I did so want to see what was on
these rocks. Come, Sue; let us climb down
on that other side.”</p>

<p>This was the side farthest away from the
bathing beach, looking straight out to sea.
They scrambled down towards the water, and
finally they came to a great hole like a well,
that seemed to go down forever.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried Rose. “I do believe
there might be a treasure hidden in the bottom
of this hole. Doesn’t it look mysterious,
Sue?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” said Sue. She did not know
what “mysterious” meant, but she thought
it had something to do with treasures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“Look, there are cracks in the side, like
steps,” said Rose. “Let’s go down.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you dare?” cried Sue. “There
might be something awful at the bottom.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Rose. “I am not afraid. I am
going down.” And she began to descend, fitting
her bare toes into the cracks of the rocks.
Sue was afraid, but she followed, for she did
not dare be left behind.</p>

<p>They went down for what seemed a long
way, when suddenly there was a funny noise
below them. “<i>Chug!</i>” went something; and
it sounded like a growl. Sue gave a loud
scream.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried. “There <i>is</i> something
down there!” And she began to scramble up.
Now Rose did not mind the “chug” so much
as she did the scream. Rose hated screams.
When Sue cried “oh!” so suddenly, it startled
Rose. She jumped; her foot slipped out of its
crack, and she fell.</p>

<p>Down she tumbled, bumping herself on the
rocks as she went. She came flat on the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
of the hole with her foot doubled under
her, and she gave a cry of pain.</p>

<p>“Oh! what is it?” called Sue, in a shaking
voice from above. “Is the creature eating you
up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” moaned Rose. “It is my foot,
my foot! It hurts me. I can’t stand up on it.
Oh! oh!” Rose was a brave little girl and
she never cried unless she was badly hurt. But
now the pain was terrible.</p>

<p>“Oh, if there isn’t any awful creature there,
I will come down and help you,” said Sue.
Presently she, too, came slipping into the bottom
of the hole. But she fell without hurting
herself. There was plenty of room for her
beside Rose. She found that they were in a
little cave. But it was not a nice one like the
pirate cave. It was damp and wet and slimy,
very cold, with the disagreeable smell of decaying
seaweed.</p>

<p>Sue looked around fearfully and shivered.
“It is a horrid place,” she said. “I am afraid
to stay here. Let’s go out quickly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>She helped Rose to her feet; but when she
tried to step poor Rose screamed with pain and
fell back in a heap.</p>

<p>“I can’t walk,” she wailed. “My foot is
broken, I think. See, it is all swelled up!”</p>

<p>Sure enough. The poor foot was turning
the most dreadful color, a mixed purple and
green, and it was twice as big as it ought to be.
Rose had twisted her ankle badly.</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall we do?” said Sue. “How
will you ever get out?”</p>

<p>Just then “chug!” came that same queer
sound. This time both Rose and Sue screamed
and looked with wide eyes down into the farther
corner of the cave, which was narrow
and dark. They expected to see some creature
come creeping out; but nothing appeared.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose it is?” whispered
Sue.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Rose. “But it is dreadful.
I want to go home.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” wailed Susan, beginning
to cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“Don’t do that!” said Rose. “It will not
do any good, you know. Oh, of course, you
will have to go home and get somebody to
come and help me.” She shuddered to think
of being left alone. “Go quickly, Sue. And
oh, do come back as soon as you can!”</p>

<p>“I will,” said Sue; and she began to climb
out of the hole. Rose’s heart sank as she heard
the sound of Sue’s feet growing fainter and
fainter, and she almost called her back; but
she bit her lips and tried to be brave. When
Sue called down “Good-by!” she felt her
heart grow very cold indeed. It sounded so
far away. Every one was so far away, and she
was alone in that dreadful place with no one
to help!</p>

<p>Just then <i>chug!</i> came that sound again.
What could it be? There surely was something
in the cave beside herself. Rose stared
fearfully into the dark corner, but still she
saw nothing. She waited nervously for the
noise to come again. There it was, louder than
ever,—<i>chug!</i> And this time a little splash of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
water spurted out of the darkness. Was some
animal splashing there?—Why, no! Of
course, it was a little wave coming in from
the sea. There must be a crack in the bottom
of the cave. Well, that was not so bad. Rose
almost laughed to think how frightened she
had been. But her foot gave a twinge of pain
and she cried “Ow!” instead.</p>

<p>Rose wondered how long she would have
to stay there. It would take some time, she
knew, for Susan to run home and bring her
father back. But already it seemed as if she
had waited for hours.</p>

<p><i>Chug!</i> came the noise again, very fiercely.
This time a spout of water spattered across
the cave into Rose’s lap. She did not like
this, and painfully drew herself as close as she
could against the wall of the cave, so that
the next wave should not reach her. But it
did reach her. In a few minutes there came
another <i>chug!</i> very loud indeed, and with it
there was a bang which seemed to shake the
rock itself. In a second a jet of water burst out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of the darkness, spattering Rose from head to
foot. She screamed, for now she knew what
it meant. The tide was rising, and the waves
were rushing into the crack at the bottom of
the cave. By and by it would be full of water,
and then what would become of her?</p>

<p>There came another <i>chug!</i> and a bang on
the wall outside, and she heard a big wave
burst over the rock. A second later the spout
of water leaped at her, bigger than ever, and at
the same time a little stream began to trickle
down into the hole from above. The waves
were dashing across Gull Rock, and soon the
cave would be flooded!</p>

<p>Poor Rose was now thoroughly frightened.
Once more she tried to rise and pull herself
up the well. But it was of no use. She could
not stand on her foot, and she sank back with
a moan.</p>

<p>Another wave dashed against the rock, and
when it trickled away it left Rose drenched
and gasping for breath. What should she do?
She knew that if something did not happen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
to help her in a few minutes, she should be
drowned. Oh, why did not Sue hurry? Why
did not Papa come?</p>

<p>“Papa! Papa!” she cried. “Oh, help,
help!—I must scream as loud as I can,” she
thought. “Sue does not know. She will not
think there is any danger yet. Perhaps if they
hear me they will hurry.—Oh, help! help!”
she cried, at the top of her lungs.</p>

<p>And then something happened!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>THE RESCUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT same morning Mr. Smith, the
hotel man, drove up to Sweetbrier Cottage.
He found Mr. Thornton sitting on the
front steps sharpening his knife.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Sir,” said Mr. Smith. “Do
you happen to know a boy named Tom?”</p>

<p>“Tom Prout? Yes, I do,” said Mr. Thornton.</p>

<p>“Well, I want to see him,” said Mr. Smith.
“I have a five-dollar bill that belongs to
him.”</p>

<p>“A five-dollar bill!” exclaimed Mr. Thornton
in surprise. “What do you mean?” Then
Mr. Smith told him the story of the mosquito
and the box of candy.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that?” said Mr.
Smith, when he had finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“I think that Tom was a brave boy to
confess before all those people,” answered Mr.
Thornton. “He did wrong, of course, but
he made up for it as well as he could. Tom
means to be a good boy, Mr. Smith.”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it,” agreed Mr. Smith
warmly, “and I want to give him a chance
to make up for that candy without paying me
a cent. I guess he will want all his money
by and by for school or for something else.
I should be glad to help him earn something
at the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Tom would like that, I know,” said Mr.
Thornton, much pleased. “He is very handy
with boats. I trust my children out with him
every day.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” cried Mr. Smith. “The very
thing! I’ll get him to row the ladies back
and forth from the yacht. I’d like to see
Tom.”</p>

<p>“I think we shall find him playing with
the other children,” said Mr. Thornton.
“Will you come with me?” (You see, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Thornton did not know that Tom was an
outlaw.)</p>

<p>The two men went along the cliff to Beech
House. It was empty except for the dolls and
the Teddy Bear which Rose and Susan had
left there when they went to look for the
treasure. Then they went on until they came
to the pirate cave. But Kenneth and Charlie
were playing there alone.</p>

<p>“Where is Tom?” asked Mr. Thornton.
“This gentleman wants to see him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Kenneth.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t play with us any more,”
added Charlie.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Mr. Thornton. But the
boys looked at each other and were silent.
They were not going to tell tales.</p>

<p>“We know all about the unlucky mosquito,”
said Mr. Thornton. “Tom was sorry,
and told Mr. Smith the whole story himself.
He gave his five dollars to pay for the candy.”</p>

<p>“Did he do that?” said Charlie, his face
brightening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Hurrah for Tom!” cried Kenneth. “I
knew he was all right.—Hello! there he goes
now in his dory. Tom! oh, Tom!”</p>

<p>Kenneth waved his hat and shouted, but
Tom did not seem to hear. He was at some
distance out in the bay, rowing towards the
bathing beach. They all shouted and waved,
and finally Tom seemed to hear, for he looked
around; but he did not show any intention of
rowing towards the cave. Perhaps he still felt
like an outlaw.</p>

<p>“He rows well,” said Mr. Smith, as Tom
disappeared around the Point.</p>

<p>“He knows more about boats than a good
many men ever learn,” said Mr. Thornton.
“I wonder where he is going.”</p>

<p>“We don’t seem likely to catch him this
morning,” said Mr. Smith; “but if you see
him, I wish you would ask him to come over
and talk with me to-morrow. Hello! what’s
this?”</p>

<p>Down the cliff scrambled Susan, panting
and disheveled. As she ran she shouted something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
which they could not understand. But
when she came nearer they made out the
word “Rose! Rose!”</p>

<p>In an instant Mr. Thornton jumped to his
feet and ran to meet her. “What is the matter?”
he cried, turning pale. “What has happened
to Rose?”</p>

<p>Presently Sue recovered enough breath to
speak brokenly. “She—she fell!” gasped
Sue. “She broke her foot, I guess. She—can’t
walk. We—were looking—for the
treasure—in the cave—out on the rocks—beyond
the bathing beach.”</p>

<p>“My poor little Rose!” gasped Mr. Thornton;
and he started on the run, followed by
the others. They all ran as fast as they could,
but it was a long way. Poor Sue had found
it so when she stumbled along going in the
other direction. Now she toiled back again
far behind the others,—behind even Mr.
Smith, who was short and fat and grew very
red as he ran. He had to stop often and mop
his forehead with his handkerchief; but Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Thornton never stopped until he came to the
bathing beach. Kenneth and Charlie were
close behind him. They heard him give a
loud cry when he looked across the beach
to Gull Rock, where Sue had said Rose was.
In a minute they saw the reason.</p>

<p>Gull Rock was now an island!</p>

<p>A wide bay of water stretched between the
rock and the shore, with only a few stones
poking up here and there on what had been
the pathway by which Rose and Sue had
crossed. It was nearly high tide. As they
looked, a great wave rolled in and covered
Gull Rock with spray.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” cried Mr. Thornton. “My
little Rose is out there! Oh, I must go to
her!” And he dashed into the water and began
to wade along the rocks of the hidden
pathway. But the stones were slippery and he
kept stumbling.</p>

<p>“You can’t do it!” yelled Mr. Smith.
“We must get a boat.”</p>

<p>“There is no boat within half a mile,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
cried Mr. Thornton, in despair. “I must try
to reach her in this way.” Just then another
great wave came rolling in. It broke against
Mr. Thornton’s knees. He lost his footing
and tottered. The pool into which he fell was
over his head, and he would have drowned if
he had not known how to swim. The water
was growing deeper all the time. “I must
swim over,” thought Mr. Thornton. “But
even if I get there safely I don’t see how I can
climb up onto those steep rocks. However, I
must try.”</p>

<p>Just as he was about to strike out into deep
water, there came a shout from Mr. Smith and
the boys on the shore. “Tom! Tom!” they
cried. “Hurrah for Tom!”</p>

<p>“Papa! Papa! come ashore!” cried Kenneth.
“Tom has Rose in his boat!”</p>

<p>Sure enough! Tom’s dory was just rounding
Gull Rock, coming fast towards shore, and
in the stern sat Rose, very pale but safe.</p>

<p>You see, Tom was just passing Gull Rock
in his dory when Rose gave that last cry for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
help. He had heard it, but at first he thought
her little shrill voice was only a sea-gull
screaming on the rock. But when he heard it
a second time cry,—“Help! oh, help!” he
pricked up his ears. No sea-gull ever spoke
words so plainly as that. Tom shouted, “Hullo
there!” in answer, and in a moment he heard
a voice cry, “Tom! Tom! come quickly!”</p>

<p>“That is Rose’s voice!” thought Tom, surprised
almost out of his wits. He rowed as
close to the rock as he dared, on account of
the surf. “Is that you, Rose?” he shouted.
“Where are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m down in a dreadful cave, Tom,” said
Rose very faintly. “My foot is broken, and
the water is coming in. Oh, come quickly,
Tom, or I shall be drowned!”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s so,” thought Tom, with a
sudden idea, as a great wave broke over Gull
Rock. “She is down in the Punch Bowl! It’s
almost high tide. Oh, I must be quick or
we’ll both be drowned.”</p>

<p>Tom had no thought of being afraid. Rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
must be saved if he could do it. Now he had
a chance to prove what a good boatman he
was. He rowed as fast as possible around Gull
Rock to a place where he thought he could
land. It was on the sheltered side of the rock,
where the waves did not break quite so heavily;
but it was difficult enough. He drew up
his boat and fastened it securely. Then he
hurried to the Punch Bowl, which was the
fisherman’s name for that dangerous cave.</p>

<p>Tom knew it well. When he came to the
hole he shouted down anxiously. Rose answered,
so he knew that she was still safe.
Down he climbed, nimbly as a monkey. At
the bottom he found the poor little girl in a
pool of water.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom!” she cried. “I am so glad!
Do you think you can get me out?”</p>

<p>“’Course I’ll get you out!” said Tom,
feeling very big. Just then a great wave came
sweeping in and nearly drowned them both.
“We must hurry,” sputtered Tom; “there’s
no time to spare. Come, Rose, you must try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
as hard as you can.” Rose tried as hard as she
could. Tom lifted and pulled and pushed, and
somehow or other he managed to help her
out of that dreadful hole. Then he half carried,
half dragged her over the rocks to his
dory. Just as they were about to push off there
came the biggest wave of all. It broke completely
over the rock, filled the boat half full
of water, and knocked both the children off
their feet. But they clung together and were
not swept into the sea.</p>

<p>“If we had been in the cave when that
wave broke,” said Tom solemnly, “we should
both have been drowned. Let’s get away before
another of those big fellows comes.”</p>

<p>He emptied the water out of the boat,
lifted Rose in, and pushed off with all his
might. The next big wave leaped after them,
burying Gull Rock under a heap of foam. But
the children had escaped. The boat was moving
through quieter waters towards the bathing
beach.</p>

<p>They heard a shout from the shore, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
looking up saw the crowd of anxious watchers.
There were Kenneth and Charlie dancing up
and down and shouting, “Hurrah!” There
was Mr. Smith, first fluttering his handkerchief,
then using it to wipe his eyes. There
was Mr. Thornton up to his waist in the water,
waving his arms and calling,—</p>

<p>“Rose! Rose! Are you safe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m safe, Papa!” cried Rose. “Tom
has saved me.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Rose was in her father’s
arms, and he was hugging and kissing her,
calling her by all her pet baby names. Mr.
Smith was shaking hands with Tom, who
looked dazed.</p>

<p>“I’m proud to know you, Tom,” he said.
“You are a regular sea-dog, my boy. We must
have you over to the hotel to help us with the
boats there.”</p>

<p>“Tom, my lad,” said Mr. Thornton, as he
started to carry Rose up to the cottage, where
her sprained ankle could be cared for, “I’ll
never forget this. Boys,” he added, turning to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Charlie and Kenneth, who stood eagerly looking
on, “if you want to see what a real hero
looks like, there he is. You had better write
it down in your pirate log-book that one of
your band saved a little girl’s life. That is
something for you to boast of, indeed.”</p>

<p>“I must go home and get dry,” muttered
Tom, turning away much embarrassed. After
all, he was an outlaw, and he knew that Mr.
Smith understood why, though Mr. Thornton
might not. Tom did not belong to the pirate
band any more. But when he turned shamefacedly
away, Kenneth and Charlie came running
up, and each seized him by the hand.</p>

<p>“Tom, old fellow, we are proud of you!”
said Kenneth heartily.</p>

<p>“Tom,” said Charlie, taking something out
of his pocket, “here is my pirate knife. You
have got to be captain now. You are the best
of us all, as Uncle Jack says.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Kenneth, dancing up
and down. “We have a real live hero for our
captain, and we will do great things!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“Oh, pshaw!” said Tom, turning red but
looking pleased. He saw that they no longer
thought him an outlaw. “I don’t want to be
captain,” he protested.</p>

<p>“You must, you must!” cried Charlie and
Kenneth. “Mustn’t he, Mr. Smith?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Mr. Smith, “I think he will
make a fine captain. But I say, Captain, I hope
you will find time to do a little un-piratical
work for me, as a plain sailor. I want you to
help with the boats at the hotel. Perhaps it
isn’t as exciting as pirating or catching mosquitoes,”
he added, with a twinkle, “but I
think you will find that it pays better.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I want to earn some money,” said
Tom. “Some day I want to go to school in
the city.”</p>

<p>“But if you go to Mr. Smith’s you won’t
have time to play with us,” said Charlie; and
Kenneth added, “Then you won’t be our pirate
captain, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes he will,” said Mr. Smith. “I’ll
only keep him a few hours every day, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
the ladies want to go sailing. Tom, will you
be my sailor man?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, everybody,” said Tom, grinning.
“I will be both, if you want me to. I’ll
be a pirate captain and an honest sailor.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a little advance wages to begin
with,” said Mr. Smith, handing Tom the famous
five-dollar bill. Tom flushed.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” he said. “But would you
mind waiting until I have earned it? I want
to start square this time.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Tom!” said Mr. Smith
approvingly. “I see that we shall be great
friends.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Smith proved to be a true prophet.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
